# blender-rand-metadata-Opensea
Project entirely created by FruitZeus, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0vjuWopx5g&amp;t=1s.

The modifications done here are entirely to the metadata generation part. The output file has the Opensea required standard.

**DISCLAIMER**: *We are not related with FruitZeus in any way. This repo provides an external App that takes as input the metadata generated by the main generation file (FZRandomizerV2_1) and outputs the Metadata according to Opensea metadata standards.*

# Instructions
1) To the output csv file add to the first row manually the parameter "Variant" before the comma so Pandas
interprets the first row as the columns instead of a Index of values.
2) Run the **csv_to_each_json.py** and generate the metadata properly.
3) If you know the IPFS directory to the images, you can edit each JSON by running the **nftMetadataEditIPFS.py** file.
