# blender-rand-metadata-Opensea
Project entirely created by FruitZeus, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0vjuWopx5g&amp;t=1s.

The modifications done here are entirely to the metadata generation part. The output file has the Opensea required standard.

# Instructions
1) To the output csv file add to the first row manually the parameter "Variant" before the comma so Pandas
interprets the first row as the columns instead of a Index of values.
